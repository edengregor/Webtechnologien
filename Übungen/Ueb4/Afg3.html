      <span class="tm">Selectors</span> are 
      patterns that match against elements in 
      a tree, and as such form one of several 
      technologies that can be used to select 
      nodes in an XML document.

    <p>
      A <span class="tm">Selector</span> 
      represents a structure. This structure 
      can be used as a condition (e.g. in a 
      CSS rule) that determines which elements 
      a selector matches in the document tree.
